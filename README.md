Hue Saturation Value
Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) is a color model that is often used in place of the RGB color model in graphics and paint programs. In using this color model, a color is specified then white or black is added to easily make color adjustments. HSV may also be called HSB (short for hue, saturation and brightness).
